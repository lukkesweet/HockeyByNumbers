<p>We’ll use the Vancouver Canucks as our example to look over team statistics. The Vancouver Canucks are currently in their 50th season after being an expansion team in 1970. Since then they have appeared in the playoffs 27 times, most recently in 2015. They have also appeared in 3 Stanley Cup finals, most recently in 2011, where they lost to the Boston Bruins in Game 7.</p>

<div id="p-points-67" class="section level3">
<h3>P: Points (67)</h3>
<p>Number of points a team has accrued. A team gains 2 points for each win and 1 point for each overtime or shootout loss. The Canucks have 31 wins and 5 overtime losses so:</p>

<div id="p-point-percentage-0.588" class="section level3">
<h3>P%: Point Percentage (0.588)</h3>

<h3>Net PK%: Net Penalty Kill Percentage (83.2)</h3>
<p>Similarly, Penalty Kill Percentage got an updated version called Net Penalty Kill Percentage which is calculated:</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at Elias Pettersson as our example for individual skater statistics. Pettersson is in his second season with the Vancouver Canucks after being drafted in 2018. He made a splash in his first season going on to win the Calder Memorial Trophy, annually given “to the player selected as the most proficient in his first year of competition in the National Hockey League.”</p>
<div id="team-team-played-for-vancouver-canucks" class="section level3">
<h3>Team: Team Played For (Vancouver Canucks)</h3>
<p>This is pretty self-explanatory. It covers which team the player is with for the given season.</p>
</div>
<div id="sc-skater-shoots-left" class="section level3">
<h3>S/C: Skater Shoots (Left)</h3>
<p>The handedness of the player. It is S/C because the same statistic is used for a goalie’s catching hand.</p>
</div>
<div id="pos-player-position-center" class="section level3">
<h3>Pos: Player Position (Center)</h3>
<p>The players position. Skaters can be a Center (C), Defender (D), Left Wing (L), or Right Wing (R).</p>
</div>
<div id="gp-games-played-56" class="section level3">

<div id="p-points-57" class="section level3">
<h3>P: Points (57)</h3>
<p>The number of points for the player in a given season. Points are calculated by adding Goals and Assists. The Art Ross Trophy is awarded to the player who has the most points at the end of the regular season. Pettersson has 23 goals and 34 assists:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P = 23 + 34 = 57\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="plus-minus-12" class="section level3">
<h3>+/-: Plus-Minus (12)</h3>
<p>Plus-Minus is a controversial statistic in hockey due to its calculation. Taking into account only even-strength and shorthanded goals<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, Plus-Minus is given a ‘plus’ for each goal scored while the player is on the ice. A ‘minus’ is given for each goal a team gives up while the player is on the ice. Plus-Minus is the difference between these two numbers.</p>

<h3>P/GP: Points per Game Played (1.02)</h3>
<p>The average number of points per game. Calculated by dividing the players points by the number of games played.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at how this was calculated for Pettersson, he’s played in 56 games and accrued 57 points:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P/GP = \frac{57}{56} = 1.02\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="evg-even-strength-goals-16" class="section level3">

<p>Number of goals scored by the player while their team is at even strength. Even strength means that both teams have the same number of players on the ice.</p>
</div>
<div id="evp-even-strength-points-36" class="section level3">
<h3>EVP: Even Strength Points (36)</h3>
<p>Number of points accrued by the player while their team is at even strength. This is again calculated as the sum of goals and assists.</p>
</div>
<div id="ppg-power-play-goals-7" class="section level3">
<h3>PPG: Power Play Goals (7)</h3>
<p>Number of goals scored by the player while their team is on a power play. A power play is when a team has more players on the ice following a penalty by the opposing team.</p>
</div>

<h3>SHP: Shorthanded Points (0)</h3>
<p>Number of points accrued by the player while their team is shorthanded.</p>
</div>
<div id="gwg-game-winning-goals-5" class="section level3">
<h3>GWG: Game Winning Goals (5)</h3>
<p>Number of game winning goals the player has scored. A game winning goal is defined by the goal a team needs to win, without scoring any additional goals. For example, if a team wins 7-4, the 5th goal is considered the game winning goal.</p>
</div>
<div id="s-shots-137" class="section level3">
<h3>S: Shots (137)</h3>
<p>Number of shots on goal the player has taken.</p>
</div>
<div id="s-shooting-percentage-16.8" class="section level3">
<h3>S%: Shooting Percentage (16.8)</h3>
<p>The shooting percentage of the player. Calculated by dividing goals by shots. Pettersson has 23 goals on 137 shots, so:</p>
